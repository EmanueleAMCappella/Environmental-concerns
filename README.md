# Environmental-concerns

An analysis on the [World Values Survey](www.worldvaluessurvey.org), with a particular focus on environmental concerns.
I wrote this code for an exam (Principle of Data Science) at City, University of London. You can find the document I submitted as a pdf file in this same folder, where I also uploaded the guide to the WORLD VALUES SURVEY.
